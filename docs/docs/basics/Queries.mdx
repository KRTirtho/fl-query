## QueryBuilder and useQuery

Most of the time you'll be using `QueryBuilder`/`useQuery` to create & manipulate Queries.

`QueryBuilder` just like any other `Builder` widget in Flutter. It has 2 required (unnamed) parameters `queryKey` and `queryFn` and 1 required named
parameter `builder`

On the other hand, `useQuery` accepts arguments just as same as `QueryBuilder` but it returns a `Query` instead of a `Widget` and doesn't have the `builder` argument

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  const Example({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return QueryBuilder<String, HttpException>(
      "todos",
      () => api.getTodos(),
      builder: (context, query) {
        if (query.isLoading) {
          return const CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
        return Text(query.data!);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

```dart
class Example extends HookWidget {
  const Example({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final query = useQuery<String, HttpException>(
      "todos",
      () => api.getTodos(),
    );

    if (query.isLoading) {
      return const CircularProgressIndicator();
    }
    return Text(query.data!);
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>

Both `QueryBuilder` and `useQuery` accepts error and success callbacks as well as configurations such as retry, `statleDuration`, `cacheDuration` etc.

## Query

The `Query` is passed to the `builder` callback or returned by `useQuery`

The `query` parameter aka `Query` contains all the useful getters, properties & methods for rendering data from the query. It contains the state of the current query, the data, the error, the loading status etc along with useful methods such as `refresh` and `setData`

### Statuses

The `query` contains the status of the current query. It has 2 types of status: 1. Query Progression status 2. Data availability status

You can access them as follows:

- Progressive status of Query
  - `isInitial`: When the passed `initialData` is being used and the query hasn't been fetched yet
  - `isLoading`: When the task function is running
  - `isRefreshing`: When new data is being fetched or simply the `refresh` method is executing
  - `isInactive`: When a query isn't used by any Widget (query isn't mounted)
- Data availability status of Query
  - `hasData`: When query contains data
  - `hasError`: When the query contains error

Now the most important part of query: Data and Error. You can access the data returned from the task using `query.data` or the error `query.error`. Both can be null. So always check if the data/error is null before accessing it

:::info
Don't use only `query.isLoading` to check if the data is available or not as the query can be failed & at this time `data` which can cause UI Exceptions. So use `query.hasData` always to check if `data` is available yet or not or use both together
:::

### Refresh

Another important part is `Query.refresh`. You can use it to manually trigger refresh or force the query to get the latest data

```dart
await query.refresh();
```

### Set data Manually

Finally, you can use `setData` to manually set the data of the query. This is useful when you want to refresh the query but the newest data is already available in the application. It can be used to reduce network traffic by saving network calls to the server. Or you can use it with `Mutations` to optimistically set data before the Mutation is executed & then update the query with actual data

```dart
await query.setData("new data"); // type of 'data' has to match the DataType
```

:::tip
You can learn more about Optimistic Updates in the [Mutation Tutorial](/docs/basics/mutations)
:::

### Dynamic key

You can also use dynamic keys with `QueryBuilder` and `useQuery`. With dart's String interpolation, you can pass dynamic keys to the query

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vanilla" label="Vanilla">

```dart
QueryBuilder<String, HttpException>(
  "todos/$todoId",
  () => api.getTodo(todoId),
  builder: (context, query) {
    /* ... */
  },
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter_hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

```dart
useQuery<String, HttpException>(
  "todos/$todoId",
  () => api.getTodo(todoId),
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> For every new `todoId`, a new query will be created and cached separately

### Lazy Query

By default queries are executed immediately after they are mounted. But you can also make them lazy by passing `enabled: false` to the `QueryBuilder` or `useQuery`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vanilla" label="Vanilla">

```dart
QueryBuilder<String, HttpException>(
  "lazy-todos",
  () => api.getTodos(),
  enabled: false,
  builder: (context, query) {
    /* ... */
  },
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter_hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

```dart
useQuery<String, HttpException>(
  "lazy-todos",
  () => api.getTodos(),
  enabled: false,
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now these queries won't be executed as soon as they're mounted. Until `Query.refresh()` or `Query.fetch()` is called these will stay in initial state. If `initial` data was passed, it'll be used until the query is refreshed. Same goes for persisting queries

### Persisting Queries

Queries can be persisted by passing `jsonConfig` argument to the `QueryBuilder` or `useQuery`. Persisted queries are stored in [hive](https://docs.hivedb.dev/) cache and are available even after the app is restarted

First make sure your custom data type is json serializable. You can use [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) package to generate `toJson` and `fromJson` methods for your data type


```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

part 'todo.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class Todo{
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final bool completed;

  Todo({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    required this.completed,
  });

  factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$TodoToJson(this);
}
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vanilla" label="Vanilla">

```dart
QueryBuilder<Todo, HttpException>(
  "todos",
  () => api.getTodos(),
  jsonConfig: JsonConfig(
    fromJson: (json) => Todo.fromJson(json),
    toJson: (todo) => todo.toJson(),
  ),
  builder: (context, query) {
    /* ... */
  },
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter_hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

```dart
useQuery<Todo, HttpException>(
  "todos",
  () => api.getTodos(),
  jsonConfig: JsonConfig(
    fromJson: (json) => Todo.fromJson(json),
    toJson: (todo) => todo.toJson(),
  ),
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Right now due to lack of reflection support and compile time macros we're unable to serialize any data type on the fly.
That's why `JsonConfig` is required. Otherwise, a simple `persistToDisk: true` would have been enough
