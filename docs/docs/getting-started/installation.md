Fl-Query is just another Flutter "package" so no extra installation step needed just install it straight from https://pub.dev

```bash
$ flutter pub add fl_query
```

### For using with `flutter_hooks`

If you're an ELITE `flutter_hooks` user or want to use `fl_query_hooks` you'll only need the `flutter_hooks` package & nothing else

```bash
$ flutter pub add flutter_hooks
```

The hooks can be imported as follows:

```dart
import 'package:fl_query/fl_query_hooks.dart';
```
