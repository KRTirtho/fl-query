All this time, we've been directly supplying `queryKey`, `queryFn` etc to `QueryBuilder` and so on. But this might looks repetetive or might break the rules of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). So to tackle this issue Fl-Query has an alternate API to create queries/infinite queries/mutations.

Jobs are nothing but a collection of arguments of `*Builder`s. It is just a more declarative way to create queries/infinite queries/mutations.

## Query Job

A `QueryJob` consists of same arguments as `QueryBuilder`

```dart
final job = QueryJob<List<Todo>, dynamic, HttpApi>(
  queryKey: "todos",
  task: (api) => api.getTodos(),
);
```

You might notice the third type argument `HttpApi`. That's the new `ArgsType`. Because QueryJob is isolated from widget tree and outside APIs are not accessible from there, you've to manually pass anything you need to the `task` function. In this case, we need an instance of `HttpApi` to call `getTodos()`.

### `QueryBuilder.withJob` and `useQueryJob`

`QueryBuilder.withJob` is a static method that takes a `QueryJob` and returns a `QueryBuilder`. It also accepts event callbacks such as `onError` and `onData`. Also a special argument called `args` which is passed to the `task` function.

Similarly, we have a `useQueryJob` if you're using `flutter_hooks`

);

  onError: (error) => print(error),
  onData: (data) => print(data),
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

  </TabItem>

## InfiniteQuery Job

Just like `QueryJob`, `InfiniteQueryJob` is the collection of arguments that is passed to `InfiniteQueryBuilder` or `useInfiniteQuery`

```dart
final job = InfiniteQueryBuilder<PagedProducts, ClientException, int, HttpApi>(
  queryKey: "products",
  task: (page, api) => api.getProductsPaginated(page),
  nextPage: (lastPage, lastPageData) {
    /// returning [null] will set [hasNextPage] to [false]
    if (lastPageData.products.length < 10) return null;
    return lastPage + 1;
  },
  initialPage: 0,
);
```

### `InfiniteQueryBuilder.withJob` and `useInfiniteQueryJob`

Just like `QueryBuilder.withJob`, `InfiniteQueryBuilder.withJob` is a static method that takes a `InfiniteQueryJob` and returns a `InfiniteQueryBuilder`. It also accepts event callbacks such as `onError` and `onData`. Also a special argument called `args` which is passed to the `task` function.

Simiarly, we have a `useInfiniteQueryJob` if you're using `flutter_hooks`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vanilla" label="Vanilla">

```dart
InfiniteQueryBuilder.withJob(
  job: job, // InfiniteQueryJob we created earlier
  args: httpApi,
  onError: (error) => print(error),
  onData: (data) => print(data),
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter_hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

```dart
useInfiniteQueryJob(
  job: job, // InfiniteQueryJob we created earlier
  args: httpApi,
  onError: (error) => print(error),
  onData: (data) => print(data),
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

## Mutation Job

For mutations we've `MutationJob` it is similar to `QueryJob` but has `mutationKey` instead of `queryKey`

```dart
final job = MutationJob<Todo, dynamic, Todo, void, HttpApi>(
  mutationKey: "create-todo",
  task: (variables, api) => api.createTodo(),
);
```

:::info
`MutationJob` has both `variables` and `args` which can be confusing. But use variables for passing data that are supposed to be sent, that means data that can change on next mutation.

Use `args` for passing anything that is not supposed to change, like an API instance, authentication info or a config etc.

### `MutationBuilder.withJob` and `useMutationJob`

Just like `QueryBuilder.withJob`, `MutationBuilder.withJob` is a static method that takes a `MutationJob` and returns a `MutationBuilder`. It also accepts event callbacks such as `onMutate`, `onError` and `onData`. Also a special argument called `args` which is passed to the `task` function.

Simiarly, we have a `useMutationJob` if you're using `flutter_hooks`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="vanilla" label="Vanilla">

```dart
MutationBuilder.withJob(
  job: job, // MutationJob we created earlier
  args: httpApi,
  onError: (error) => print(error),
  onData: (data) => print(data),
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flutter_hooks" label="Flutter Hooks">

useInfiniteQueryJob(
  job: job, // MutationJob we created earlier
  args: httpApi,
  onError: (error) => print(error),
  onData: (data) => print(data),
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

## Dynamic Jobs

Every job has `.withVariableKey` static that allows creating queries/mutations with changing data on the fly. It returns a function that accepts a variable key (String). Which will create a new instance of the job with the new variable key.

Here's the example usage for `Query`:

```dart
final job = QueryJob.withVariableKey<List<Todo>, dynamic, HttpApi>(
  baseQueryKey: "todos/", // the variable key will be appended to this
  task: (variableKey, api) => api.getTodo(variableKey),
);

// later in the widget tree
QueryBuilder.withJob(
  job: job(todoId),
  args: httpApi,
  builder: /* ... */,
);
```

Everything is just as same as for `Mutation` and `InfiniteQuery`..
